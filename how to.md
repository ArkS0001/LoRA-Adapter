## Step-by-Step: How to Do It

Here’s how you could implement the “1 base model + many adapters” setup using Groq.

| Step                                                      | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Choose base model(s)**                               | Pick a base model that Groq supports and which matches your customers’ needs (size, latency, capabilities). Example: `llama-3.1-8b-instant`. ([GroqCloud][3])                                                                                                                 |
| **2. Train / obtain LoRA adapters**                       | Use external tools (e.g. PEFT + HuggingFace, Unsloth, or your own fine-tuning pipelines) to build LoRA adapters for each customer domain / vertical. Each adapter is small (relative to full model fine-tune), so cost is lower and iteration is faster.                      |
| **3. Package the adapter**                                | Build a ZIP containing — typically —<br> • `adapter_model.safetensors` (your LoRA weights, in float16) <br> • `adapter_config.json` (contains things like `r` (rank), `lora_alpha`, and maybe other meta) ([GroqCloud][1])                                                    |
| **4. Upload the adapter to Groq**                         | Use their API endpoint `/files` with `purpose="fine_tuning"` to upload the zip. That gives you a file ID. ([GroqCloud][1])                                                                                                                                                    |
| **5. Register adapter as a “fine-tuned” (adapter) model** | Use the `fine_tunings` API to register the uploaded file ID, specify the base\_model and name/type (“lora”) etc. That returns a unique model ID for inference. ([GroqCloud][1])                                                                                               |
| **6. Use the model ID in inference**                      | When you want to serve customer A, customer B etc., you call the inference API (e.g. `chat.completions` etc.) with the model ID of the respective LoRA adapter model. Swapping is just a matter of using a different model ID per request (or per customer). ([GroqCloud][1]) |

## Example (Pseudocode)

Here’s what this might look like roughly in code:

```python
# assume you've built adapter for customer A, packaged it

# Step: upload
resp = http_post(
    "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/files",
    headers={ "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}" },
    params={ "purpose": "fine_tuning" },
    files={ "file": ("custA.zip", open("custA.zip", "rb")) }
)
file_id = resp.json()["id"]

# Step: register
resp2 = http_post(
    "https://api.groq.com/v1/fine_tunings",
    headers={ "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}", "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    json={
        "input_file_id": file_id,
        "name": "custA-adapter",
        "type": "lora",
        "base_model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant"
    }
)
model_id_A = resp2.json()["data"]["fine_tuned_model"]

# Step: inference
resp3 = http_post(
    "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={ "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}", "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    json={
        "model": model_id_A,
        "messages": [
            { "role": "user", "content": "Some customer A specific prompt ..." }
        ]
    }
)
print(resp3.json())
```

And similarly for each customer you have one adapter → one registered model ID → use accordingly.

## Considerations / Gotchas

* **Cold start latency**: For LoRA adapters, when you load (swap) a new adapter that hasn't been “hot” in memory, there might be some overhead (“cold start”). The rank of the adapter matters: higher `r` means more overhead. ([GroqCloud][1])
* **Costs**: Base cost for inference is similar to using the base model once; you only pay extra for storage / swapping / perhaps some small overhead. It’s *much* cheaper than maintaining totally separate full-fine-tuned instances. Groq’s own documentation claims \~90% reduction (which matches your estimates) if you do this right. ([Groq][2])
* **Version compatibility**: The adapter must be trained with exactly the same version / variant of the base model that Groq supports. If you train LoRA against a slightly different base, it might not load correctly. ([GroqCloud][1])
* **Supported ranks**: As said: ranks 8, 16, 32, 64 are allowed. You’ll need to choose (and trade off adapter expressivity vs memory / loading latency). ([GroqCloud][1])
* **Enterprise access**: Groq’s LoRA support is currently Enterprise-only. If your client is not on that tier, they’ll need to upgrade / request access. ([Groq][2])
